# Tableau_dashboards
Example visualizations

This repository contains my Tableau dashboards and visualizations as a sampling tool and data exploration tool only.

 This dashboard contains choropleth maps for the Sample Superstore data that comes with the tableau desktop software and shows a population density layer from the 2018 US population census. It does a great job at layering the information for in-depth analysis but also a quick scan of the overall trends state-to-state. The name of the file is "sales_profits.twb" and the data comes from the Sample Superstore dataset
