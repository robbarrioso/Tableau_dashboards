# Tableau_dashboards
Example visualizations

This repository contains my Tableau dashboards and visualizations as a sampling tool and data exploration tool only.

 This dashboard contains CHOROPLETH maps for the Sample Superstore data that comes with the tableau desktop software and shows a population density layer from the 2018 US population census. It does a great job at layering the information for in-depth analysis but also a quick scan of the overall trends state-to-state. The name of the file is "sales_profits.twb" and the data comes from the Sample Superstore dataset

		While hovering a datapoint on the map a breakdown of state sales by postal code shows the marginal costs, profits, and overall amounts.
		The size of the circular datapoints varies by sales amounts.

		The dashboard has filters for one or multiple states and updates the maps according to user selection.

A quick look at the dashboard and we can see that most sales come from high population density areas like California and New York. Meanwhile places like Houston, TX, a high density population, although high sales also has negative profits.
